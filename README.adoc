Summary
Android Developer Needed for Pose Detection & Image Capture Module

SEE THE ATTACHED VIDEO for reference

We’re developing a mobile feature that captures user images for body measurement analysis. To ensure accuracy and usability, we need an experienced Android developer to implement a native module that handles:

1. Phone Position Detection + Overlay Guidance

Objective

Ensure the phone is held upright before capturing an image to reduce pose detection errors.

Responsibilities
- Use the **accelerometer** to detect device orientation (e.g., Z-axis threshold for upright position).
- Implement a **calibration routine** to help users align their phone vertically across different devices.
- Display **dynamic overlays** for both **front view** and **side view** to guide user positioning.

**Tech Stack**: Android Jetpack, Sensor APIs, UI overlays

2. Pose Detection with ML Kit

**Objective**: Validate user posture before triggering image capture.

**Responsibilities**:
- Integrate **ML Kit Pose Detection API**.
- Analyze live camera feed to detect key landmarks (shoulders, hips, knees).
- Implement logic for:
- **Front View**: Face and both shoulders visible and symmetrical.
- **Side View**: Profile alignment (ear, shoulder, hip on a consistent plane).

3. Image Capture + API Integration

**Objective**: Capture validated images and send them to our backend for measurement analysis.

**Responsibilities**:
- Trigger camera capture once pose is validated.
- Apply different capture logic for front vs. side views.
- Compress and format image as needed (Optional)
- Send image + metadata via POST request to backend API.
- Handle API response and update local data or UI accordingly.


Additional Requirements

- **Error Handling**: Gracefully manage sensor failures, pose detection issues, and network errors.
- **Testing & Calibration**: Ensure reliability across devices and environments.
- **Privacy & Permissions**: Secure image transmission and proper access to sensors/camera.
- **Modular Design**: Keep accelerometer, pose detection, and API logic modular for future updates.

Ideal Candidate

- Strong experience with **Android Jetpack**, **ML Kit**, and **sensor APIs**
- Proficient in **camera integration**, **image processing**, and **API communication**
- Bonus: Experience with body measurement or fitness apps

If you’re excited to build a smart, sensor-driven image capture module with native Android tools, we’d love to hear from you!
